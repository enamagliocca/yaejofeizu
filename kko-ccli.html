(October 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message). Hello! I'm a pastor at a small, rural church who uses YouTube as an archival system and to share sermons and more to our shut-ins. As I have been doing this, every now and again we use songs that are should be monetized, but we fall under the CCLI (Christian Copyright Licensing Int'l) https://us.ccli.com/ (https://us.ccli.com/) and do not monetize our videos. Is there any way to respectfully remove the ads from the videos, should they appear? My understanding of the system is limited

This is word art created from grabbing the lyrics from the top 10 "worship" songs on CCLI (Christian Copyright Licensing International). I've been a worship leader at Evangelical churches for 10+ years but I've been on a journey of deconstruction and reconstruction over the last 5 years. I still attend an Evangelical church and I love them but I also love to try to pull the curtain back a little bit and try to think deeply about what it really means to follow Jesus. So i've been on a thing recen. CCLI simplifies access to affordable legal content and media. With the proper license, SongSelect offers real-time access to songs of worship and the resources to perform. Since googling "easy arrangements for a choir to sing with the worship band" didn't get me anywhere, I figured maybe some fellow worship leading Redditors could help! My worship band wants to add a small choir (around 10 adults signed up) to sing with us on Easter Sunday. I am director of the Worship Arts Ministry, therefore I am in charge of this, but I don't know how to find easy arrangements to teach people! I could even make them but I think that would take too long at this point, unless. My church, like many, plays music at church. My understanding is that they can use all the songs they like freely during the service without paying any fees. This covers the Sunday morning services. However, we also broadcast our service online and get a bunch of viewers there. Is the church allowed to put the whole service "live" like that without paying fees for the music. 
One of the goals that I'm setting for my worship team next year is to record an album of 10 of our best songs. There has been a real desire in our congregation for one and the team is at a place where I think it could sound really good. amp#x200B; I'm a fairly competent musician, but I don't know nearly as much as I would like to about copyright law. As this album will be made up of covers and will be sold to our congregation I want to make sure that I'm doing everything that is required. Why is it that worship/praise music has homogenised into one main genre (that I would describe as contemporary pop country)? I explore the 'Christian' music charts (which I hate to describe as Christian as music cannot have a faith) to find it all sounds the same; piano backed with atmospheric pads and lead guitar drenched in delay following similar chord progressions between songs. Why is it seen that worship needs to follow this formula? Worship music shouldn't be seen as a genre, but merely. Here's a question I have had for a while. I don't fully understand CCLI and our church plays a lot of songs that aren't super well known and we frequently sing songs that are not in the CCLI database. Is there something that I need to do to cover licensing for those songs. Where do you hear new songs. 
Shazam has failed me. I'm doing this as part of a present for my friend's upcoming birthday. I have tried to Shazam it, to no avail. I've googled the lyrics, still nothing. It's a song a group of kids sang at a crusade at the Rose Bowl (I think it was in 2006). Here are some of the lyrics. "I'm right here before You, asking on my knees that my life would be something. And not just what I dreamed. That I might find favor, Mercy and grace. In the eyes of my Savior, In the light I work the projector's at my grandmother's small church. Almost everybody there is really old, and not tech savvy. Recently, one of the leaders has started asking me to convert Christian music off YouTube to MP3s and send him the music so he can play it in service and we can sing along. Problem is, I'm not sure about the legalities. I definitely don't want to steal anything! He insists that it's okay because they hold a CCLI (Christian Copyright License International) that "specifically. You are in charge of the United Armies of Earth who are planning an invasion of Equestria. I am staging a hypothetical situation that is rooted in reality. There is a ministry that I'm supporting, by doing the worship leading at occasional meetings. They help people, that's all I care about. But money is scarce all around, and they do not have any money allocated in their budget for songbooks (through the years, people have brought them home, now there's too few to bring). And they've never used a CCLI license. If you were in my shoes, what would I run a small (just me and my gear) recording studio in a small town in Michigan, USA that I have only ever used for original work. A local church worship team contacted me to help them produce a CD in order to raise funds. I would not be charging them for my services, but during rehearsal I learned that some of their tracks will be covers of contemporary christian artists. They stated that they did not wish to copy the songs precisely, and that most of the tracks are played heavily Specifically, a CCLI license ( which is a special form of copyright for religious music (and other media). I write music for the church where I am the director of worship, and license everything under CC Attribution 4.0 International.
