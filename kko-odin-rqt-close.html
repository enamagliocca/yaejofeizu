Little did I know the videos I'd watched earlier. The Radar Emitter Database (REDB) covers over 11,000 records.

I've been trying for days now to root my N910F International Galaxy Note 4 and Odin keeps failing every time. It's driving me nuts as I've tried everything I can think of. If someone could help me troubleshoot this I'd be very grateful. I've tried the following: 1) Re-flash official ROM N910FXXU1BOB4_N910FOXA1BOB4_DBT 2) Tried flashing using four different versions of Odin (v1.85, v3.07, v3.09 and v3.10.6) 3) Tried different recovery's (TWRP and CF Auto Root) 4) Un-installed Samsung drivers. Samsung Galaxy SIII, SGH-T999 on Tmobile My phone restarted today on its own and then was stuck on the "Samsung Galaxy SIII" splash. Numerous soft resets gave the same result. I tried booting into the boot menu (volume up + home + power) and would only get a small "Recovery Booting." message at the top followed by a dead android with a red caution icon above it. Doesn't look good. I am able to boot into download mode (volume down + home + power), so I tried to flash the stock So I've messed up my phone pretty hard and seriously need some help.

A little background: I rooted my Samsung Galaxy s5 (Verizon) in August, 2014. No third-party ROM was installed; just root with Nova Pro, Gravitybox, and Xposed. Hello everyone! It has been some difficult 48 hours for me since I decided to root my phone. The stupid reason? I want to play Pokemon Go on it and this model has only 512 MB RAM so after a bit of searching I stumbled upon some tutorials on how to use SD card memory as RAM memory and I thought I'd give it a shot. Basic requirement was for the phone to be rooted. The search of the root file for my device was a bit of a problem. I thought I had founded it, used Odin 3.11 to download EDIT: I solved it already, see bottom for solution I think I screwed up big time. Thank you so much if you think you can help me. I recently got a Samsung S5+, and decided to try and root it. I've tried using kingroot, kingoroot but neither worked.

The directions I'm following around found here under Root Method #2. . I've made the necessary downloads FIXED: For anyone who stumbles upon this thread I managed to fix mine by downloading the file found HERE ( and following the instructions in the dudes last post. I'm gonna try and figure out how to root the i9000t properly now but I'll start a new thread for that. New thread can be found HERE ( Alright.so I really should 
This a bit of a doozy, I've been trying on and off for a year now to unbrick my Note 10.1, it literally ran out of battery one day and has hung on the boot screen ever since. It has got CWMR 6.0.3.6 on it, can browse extSD just fine, however it can't flash anything successfully (even an old Omni Rom I had on the card and previously flashed just fine with the same recovery).
